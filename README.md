# STA2453: Zooplankton Classification

Author: Markus Kangur

This is the repository for my zooplankton classification project from STA2453 at the University of Toronto. Zooplankton are a diverse class of microscopic marine organisms that can be useful indicators of ecosystem health. However, it is difficult and time consuming to classify images manually. The goal of this project is to develop a discriminative model to classify zooplankton according to their species using the image mosaics and auxiliary/geometric information in a dataset from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. Analysis and modelling will be completed in R while adhering (hopefully) to the <a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html">Tidyverse style guide</a>. If successful, this model will facilitate more efficient and cost-effective aquatic ecosystem monitoring.
