# STA2453: Zooplankton Classification
Zooplankton are a diverse class of microscopic marine organisms that drift with the tides and currents of the waters they inhabit. The goal of this project is to train a discriminative model to classify zooplankton by species using images and auxiliary information provided in a dataset from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. This report details the exploratory data analysis conducted to better understand the characteristics of the dataset through preliminary exploration and visualization. The results will be used to inform future modelling-related decisions.
