# STA2453: Zooplankton Classification

Author: Markus Kangur

This is the repository for my zooplankton classification project from STA2453 at the University of Toronto. Zooplankton are a diverse class of microscopic marine organisms that can be useful indicators of ecosystem health. The goal of this project is to develop a discriminative model to classify zooplankton according to their species using the information in a dataset from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. Analysis and modelling will be completed in R while adhering (hopefully) to the <a href="https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html">Tidyverse style guide</a>. If successful, this model will facilitate more efficient and cost-effective aquatic ecosystem monitoring.

<code>Code</code> contains the R scripts needed to run the analysis.<br>
<code>Data</code> contains the link to the data source as well as other data information.<br>
<code>Figures</code> contains image files of the figures in the reports.<br>
<code>Results & Reports</code> contains all reports and write-ups to do with the project.
